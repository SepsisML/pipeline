# Sepsis Prediction Pipeline

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for sepsis prediction. The project is organized into several components, each serving a specific purpose.

## Project Structure

### Folders Overview

- **data/**: Contains the dataset for sepsis prediction (`sepsis_dataset.csv`).
- **models/**: Stores the machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **pipelines/**: Includes scripts for training, validation, and data processing.
- **utils/**: Utility functions for preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation.

## How to Run
1. **Create python environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
3. **Activate environment (Windows)**:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
